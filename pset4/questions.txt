0.  BMP: over 4 billion
    JPEG: 16 million
    PNG: 16 million
    GIF: 256
    
1.  GIF supports animation

2.  Lossless compression allows the conversion and recovery of files between formats, hence has to maintain the bits while compression.
    Lossy compression on the other hand, throws away some of the image data which prevents it from being recoverable.
    
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed and hence has least file size.

4.  Technically, when a file is deleted from FAT filesystem, it erases the information from the address table but maintains the copy of file on the hard drive.

5.  Using secure delete option will replace the file bits by 0 on the system and hence ensures it's not recoverable. 

6.  Stdint.h is a header file that declares specified integer types as having a certain width.

7.  It gives clarity on the way user intends to use the data. 

8.  BYTE - 1 byte
	DWORD - 4 bytes
	LONG - 4 bytes
	WORD - 2 bytes
	
9.  BM

10. bfSize gives the byte-size of the bitmap file.
	biSize gives the byte-size of the structure.
	
11. The bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) with upper-left-corner origin.

12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
	
13. fopen returns NULL if it cannot create the output file to write to.

14. Because it reads 1 RGB triple at a time (according to the comments).

15. If the width is 3, padding is necessary since the scanline must be a multiple of 4.
	3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel gives 9 bytes and 3 bytes are added to bring the scanline to 12 bytes.
	
16. Skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple)

17. This is an integer constant which specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position
	
18. um...teddy bear-type figure!
